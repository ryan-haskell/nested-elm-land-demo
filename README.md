# Elm Land - Nested Folders
> Demo of Elm Land frontend with another backend

## Local development

```
pnpm start
```

## Scripts

### pnpm start

Just a helper command that runs `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` together, for one command that "just works ™️" on a new machine

### pnpm dev

Runs project locally without the `pnpm install` step

### pnpm build

Runs all build stuff (just `elm-land build` for now!)
